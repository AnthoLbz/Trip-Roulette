Trip-Roulette:

- I coded this game with my team for our 1st Hackaton, during my Web Develloper course @ Wild Code School Marseille. It is made using the Windy API. Thanks to this, you can travel from your couch, and avoid the covid-19 :)

- You can play it here: https://trip-roulette.netlify.app/

- Do not read the code to learn something, it's probably full of bad practices.

- Click the button to make the wheel appear.

- Once you have your result, click on it to make the webcam appear.

- Click on the right t oexit the wheel.

- If you want to try again, click on the title to reset the page and start over.

- Have fun!
